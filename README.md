# Verilog Traffic Light Controller
## Project Overview
This project represents my initial experiments with the Sipeed Tang Primer 20K FPGA (GW2A-LV18PG256C8/I7), focusing on traffic light control using Verilog. The main objective was to develop a basic traffic light controller that sequentially manages LEDs, alternating between red, yellow, and green with defined timing.

## Description
The Verilog code implements the traffic light control logic, defining the LED activation sequence. This sequence is generated by a counter that cycles through the different states, ensuring:

Sequential LED control (red → yellow → green → red)

Precise timing for each light phase

Automatic cycling (no reset required)
